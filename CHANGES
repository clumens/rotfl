version 0.6.5
=============
- Stripped the ampersands from procedure calls.  We don't really need those.
- Initialization and closing subroutines broken into two parts: a global part
  and a file-specific part.
- Main processing loop wrapped in another while in order to loop over all input
  files.

version 0.6.4
=============
- Moved all the environment variable handling to the beginning of the
  program.  Instead of declaring them up at the top and then initializing
  them later in rotfl_init(), I just moved everything into a hash and
  initialize them at the same time.

version 0.6.3
=============
- Created CHANGES file for documenting source code changes.
- Metadata for all records is now stored in one hash of hashes.  It is still
  called the "toc", but now it holds more than just the title and the starting
  line number.  The hash is indexed by line number.  Then, the rest of the
  metadata is stored within the hash.
- In order to accomodate the revised table of contents, a new variable keeps
  track of what line number the current record started on.  This allows us
  to pull the correct information out of the hash.
- All string processing dealing with the metadata has been moved into the
  preprocessor code.
- I removed the functions that are supposed to be updating variables for the
  metadata.  The preprocessor now deals with that.

- allow multiple tags per line (major rewriting...ugh)
- place metadata into some sort of include file (?)
- have one tag for a line (A, D, etc) and one for a block (L, H, etc) (?)

bugs to work out
================
- strangeness occurs when using table of contents under xterm.  figure that out.

- fix line numbers for record skipping action

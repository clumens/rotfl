Here's your warning right now...

For now, I am maintaining compatibility with older versions of documents
(hence the versioning tag).  This introduces a lot of redundant code because
I have to check the version and do something appropriately.  Older document
versions will need something different done than in the newer version.

Right now, this is only a problem with the numbered lists and such.  But it
will probably become more and more of a problem as I create some new features
and such.  It's going to get rather unmanagable.  So, this is the warning:

When I finally reach version 1.0, I am going to reset the compatibility
issues.  That is, documents created for pre 1.0 releases will be formatted
according to the 1.0 rules.  I will then start supporting backwards
compatibility for everything that comes after 1.0.

So, please take the time to update your documents as new versions come out.
I hate doing this, but I also do not want to make too much of a problem for
myself.  If you really think this is a bad idea, give me a mail and we
can talk it over.

Thanks for using rotfl, and I will continue to work on updates and 
improvements.
